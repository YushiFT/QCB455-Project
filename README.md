Re-evaluate ultrarare variants’ contribution to cis-heritability of human gene expression

### Goal

1. Re-evaluate the power of H-E regression and REML method to estimate the contribution of alleles with different MAFs to the phenotypic variation via reproducing the simulations. I will go further to discuss the biasedness and asymptotic characteristics of these estimators to better evaluate their performance. Then I may have some insights into the effects of method selection on the overall conclusion about ultrarare variants’ contribution to cis-heritability.

2. Applying the H-E regression model to recalculating the heritability enrichment across different MAFs. Together with goal 1, we can validate the reliability of Hernandez’s study results and conclusions. Additionally, I would adjust the PCA procedure to the most commonly used one to compare the ultimate results. Due to the time limitation and the large data size, I may only be able to repeat the analysis on a subset of the 360 European cohorts. Please see appendix as the figures that I would like to replicate from the original paper.
